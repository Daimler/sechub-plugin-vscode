This is an VSCode/VSCodium/Eclipse Theia plugin for a convenient IDE integration of https://github.com/mercedes-benz/sechub[SecHub].

=== Features

=== Installation

Recommended: Install the plugin from the Open-VSX marketplace from within https://vscodium.com/[VSCodium] or https://theia-ide.org/[Eclipse Theia] by searching for the term: `sechub` in the `Extensions` manager.

For VS Code you need to download the https://open-vsx.org/extension/mercedes-benz/sechub[plugin] and install it manually. It is also possible to install the plugin manually in VSCodium and Eclipse Theia.
